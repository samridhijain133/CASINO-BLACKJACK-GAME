# CASINO-BLACKJACK-GAME
BLACKJACK  also known as 21, is a popular casino game played worldwide. It is basically a player vs dealer game.
There are some simple rules for this game:-
Blackjack hands are scored by their point total. The hand with the highest total wins as long as it doesn't exceed 21; a hand with a higher total than 21 is said to bust. Cards 2 through 10 are worth their face value, and face cards (jack, queen, king) are also worth 10. An ace's value is 11 unless this would cause the player to bust, in which case it is worth 1.
The goal of each player is to beat the dealer by having the higher, unbusted hand. 
If both the player and the dealer have the same point value, it is called a "push", and neither player nor dealer wins the hand
The minimum bet is printed on a sign on the table and varies from casino to casino, and even table to table.
I have tried making a simple BLACKJACK GAME with the help of python.
